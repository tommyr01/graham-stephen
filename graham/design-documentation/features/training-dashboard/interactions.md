# Training Dashboard Interactions and Animation Specifications

## Interaction Design Philosophy

The Training Dashboard prioritizes **natural, encouraging interactions** that make AI training feel intuitive and rewarding. Every interaction should reinforce the user's sense of collaboration with their AI system, providing immediate feedback and clear progress indicators.

### Core Interaction Principles

1. **Immediate Feedback**: Every user action receives instant visual or audio feedback
2. **Progress Transparency**: Users always understand what's happening and what comes next
3. **Encouraging Guidance**: Interactions guide users toward successful training outcomes
4. **Error Prevention**: Interface design prevents common mistakes before they occur
5. **Celebration of Contribution**: Successful training actions receive meaningful acknowledgment
