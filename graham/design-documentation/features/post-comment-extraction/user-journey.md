**Experience Level**: Familiar with LinkedIn, new to research automation tools

### Journey Narrative
Sarah discovered a viral LinkedIn post from a sales thought leader discussing challenges with lead generation. The post has 200+ comments from sales professionals sharing their experiences. Instead of manually clicking through each commenter's profile, she wants to use the research tool to quickly identify the most relevant prospects for her outreach.

## Entry Points & Contexts

## Error Scenarios & Recovery

### Invalid URL Format

**Trigger**: User enters non-LinkedIn URL or malformed link
**System Response**: 
- Real-time validation shows error state
- Clear error message: "Please enter a valid LinkedIn post URL"
- Example of correct format provided
- Input field highlights in error color

**User Actions**:
- Corrects URL format
- Tries different LinkedIn post
- Seeks help documentation

**Recovery Design**:
```
‚ùå Error State:
"This doesn't appear to be a LinkedIn post URL. 
Please check the format and try again.

‚úÖ Example: https://linkedin.com/posts/username_activity-12345"
```

**Success Metrics**: >90% of users successfully retry after format error

### Private or Deleted Post

**Trigger**: URL points to private, deleted, or restricted post
**System Response**:
- API call fails with specific error code
- User-friendly error message explains access limitation
- Suggestions for alternative approaches provided

**Error Message Design**:
```
üîí This post is private or no longer available.

This could happen if:
‚Ä¢ The post author restricted visibility
‚Ä¢ The post has been deleted
‚Ä¢ You don't have permission to view this post

Try a different LinkedIn post, or make sure you're logged into LinkedIn.
```

**Recovery Options**:
- Try different post URL
- Check LinkedIn login status
- Contact support if issue persists

### Network/API Failures

**Trigger**: Network timeout, LinkedIn API unavailable, or rate limiting
**System Response**:
- Detect specific failure type
- Provide appropriate error message
- Offer retry mechanism with intelligent backoff

**Error Handling Strategy**:
- **Timeout**: "The request is taking longer than expected. Try again?"
- **Rate Limit**: "LinkedIn has temporarily limited requests. Try again in 5 minutes."
- **API Unavailable**: "LinkedIn's service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later."

**User Actions**:
- Automatic retry after delay
- Manual retry button
- Check system status page

### No Comments Found

**Trigger**: Valid post URL but post has no comments
**System Response**:
- Successful API call but empty results
- Explanatory message about empty results
- Suggestions for alternative posts

**Message Design**:
```
üìù This post doesn't have any comments yet.

Try:
‚Ä¢ A more popular post with more engagement
‚Ä¢ Posts from industry thought leaders
‚Ä¢ Recent posts about trending topics
```

## Edge Cases

### Extremely Large Posts (500+ comments)

**Challenge**: Posts with hundreds of comments may cause performance issues
**Solution Design**:
- Implement pagination with progressive loading
- Show initial batch (first 50-100 comments) immediately
- "Load More Comments" button for additional batches
- Progress indicator for large extractions

**User Communication**:
```
üìä Large post detected (500+ comments)

Loading comments in batches for better performance:
‚Ä¢ Batch 1 of 5 complete (100 comments loaded)
‚Ä¢ [Continue Loading] or [Work with current results]
```

### LinkedIn Format Changes

**Challenge**: LinkedIn occasionally changes post URL formats
**Solution Design**:
- Flexible URL parsing that adapts to format variations
- Fallback patterns for older URL formats
- Clear error messages when new formats aren't supported yet

**User Experience**:
- Graceful degradation when formats change
- Clear communication about temporary limitations
- Rapid updates to support new formats

### Mixed Content Types

**Challenge**: Posts with mixed media (videos, images, polls) may have different comment structures
**Solution Design**:
- Robust comment extraction that handles various post types
- Consistent commenter information regardless of post format
- Clear indication of post type in results

### International/Non-English Posts

**Challenge**: Posts in different languages or from international LinkedIn versions
**Solution Design**:
- Unicode support for all languages
- Consistent extraction regardless of language
- Proper handling of right-to-left languages

**User Considerations**:
- Comment previews may be in original language
- Profile information displays in user's preferred language when available
- Character encoding handled properly for all writing systems
