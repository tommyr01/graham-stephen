## Feature 1: Content Intelligence Engine

### 1.1 AI Content Analysis
**User Story**: As Graham, I want the system to detect when LinkedIn posts are authentic vs AI-generated so I can quickly identify genuine prospects.

**Technical Requirements**:
- Integration with OpenAI/Claude API for content analysis
- Real-time analysis of all LinkedIn posts
- Caching system for analyzed content
- Batch processing for historical posts

**Analysis Criteria**:
```typescript
interface ContentAnalysis {
  authenticityScore: number;      // 1-10 (human vs AI generated)
  expertiseLevel: number;         // 1-10 (industry knowledge depth)
  specificityScore: number;       // 1-10 (concrete vs generic)
  professionalismScore: number;   // 1-10 (writing quality)
  redFlags: string[];            // Detected issues
  reasoning: string;             // AI explanation
}
```

**Content Red Flags**:
- Generic motivational quotes
- Obvious AI-generated patterns
- Lack of specific industry details
- Copy-paste content from others
- Inconsistent writing style across posts

### 1.2 Industry Expertise Detection
**User Story**: As Graham, I want to quickly see if someone demonstrates real M&A knowledge in their posts, not just surface-level business talk.

**Technical Requirements**:
- M&A-specific terminology analysis
- Deal experience verification through content
- Industry knowledge consistency checking
- Professional credibility signal detection

**Expertise Signals**:
- Specific deal value references
- Actual client situation descriptions
- Industry-specific terminology usage
- Consistent posting over time periods
- Engagement with relevant industry content

### 1.3 Content Authenticity Scoring
**User Story**: As Graham, I want to avoid prospects who post generic AI content as they likely won't have genuine business conversations.

**Implementation**:
```typescript
async function analyzeContentAuthenticity(posts: LinkedInPost[]): Promise<{
  overallAuthenticity: number;
  postScores: Array<{
    postId: string;
    authenticityScore: number;
    signals: string[];
    concerns: string[];
  }>;
  trend: 'improving' | 'declining' | 'consistent';
  recommendation: 'contact' | 'investigate' | 'skip';
}> {
  // AI analysis implementation
}
```

## Feature 2: Training Mode Integration

### 2.1 Simple Training Toggle on Profile Research Page
**User Story**: As Graham, I want to enable training mode on the existing Profile Research page so the system learns from my decisions without changing my current workflow.

**UI/UX Integration**:
- Simple toggle switch at top of existing Profile Research page
- When ON: Training feedback section appears below normal analysis
- When OFF: Page works exactly as it does now
- No separate interfaces or complex workflows

**Enhanced Workflow**:
1. Graham goes to Profile Research page (same as always)
2. Optionally enables "Training Mode" toggle
3. Enters LinkedIn profile URL and analyzes (same as current)
4. Reviews normal profile analysis (unchanged)
5. NEW: Training feedback section appears at bottom when toggle is ON
6. Makes quick CONTACT/SKIP decision with optional voice reasoning
7. System learns while Graham continues his normal workflow

**Data Captured**:
```typescript
interface TrainingDecision {
  prospectId: string;
  grahamDecision: 'contact' | 'skip';
  confidence: number;           // 1-10 Graham's certainty
  decisionTime: number;         // milliseconds
  reasoning?: string;           // voice-to-text transcription
  profileSnapshot: {
    basicInfo: any;
    recentPosts: LinkedInPost[];
    contentAnalysis: ContentAnalysis;
    currentScore: number;
  };
  timestamp: string;
}
```

### 2.2 Voice Reasoning Capture
**User Story**: As Graham, I want to quickly record my reasoning after making a decision so the system learns my thought process.

**Simple Implementation**:
- Optional "🎤 Voice Note" button appears in training feedback section
- One-click recording with visual feedback
- Automatic speech-to-text transcription
- Quick review and edit capability
- No complex setup or separate interfaces

**Training Feedback UI**:
```
┌─────────── TRAINING FEEDBACK ───────────┐
│ Would you contact this prospect?         │
│ [CONTACT]      [SKIP]                   │
│                                          │
│ Confidence: ●●●●●●●○○○ (7/10)          │
│                                          │
│ [🎤 Voice Note] (optional)              │
│ [Submit & Next Profile]                 │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Reasoning Analysis**:
- Extract key decision factors from voice notes
- Learn Graham's vocabulary and patterns
- Identify consistent decision criteria
- Build predictive reasoning models

## Feature 3: Predictive Scoring Engine

    concerningSignals: string[]; // Potential red flags
    similarProspects: Array<{   // Historical similar cases
      prospectId: string;
      similarity: number;
      grahamDecision: 'contact' | 'skip';
      outcome?: string;
    }>;
  };
  scoreBreakdown: {
    contentAuthenticity: number;
    industryExpertise: number;
    experienceRelevance: number;
    professionalCredibility: number;
    redFlagPenalty: number;

**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface SimilarityMatch {
  prospectId: string;
  similarity: number;         // 0-1 similarity score
  matchingFactors: string[];  // What makes them similar
  grahamDecision: 'contact' | 'skip';
  outcome?: {
    contacted: boolean;
    responded: boolean;
    meetingHeld: boolean;
    dealClosed: boolean;
  };
  reasoning: string;          // Graham's original reasoning
